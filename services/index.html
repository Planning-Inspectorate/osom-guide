      <h2 class="sub-title">Services</h2>
      <p>OSOM services and the network of interactions they form are two key parts of OSOM, the other being the <a href="/executive">executive</a>.</p>
<p>The service network does the heavy lifting for the organisation. It delivers against the user needs that the organisation attempts to address for third parties or the needs that arise through tackling those.</p>
<p>They're not end-to-end silos or a transaction. They are discrete capabilities that can be assembled as components by other, increasingly higher-order capabilities, ultimately to present those customer journeys to users.</p>
<p>Services are managed by service managers and are periodically assessed by the executive - at minimum each time the service progresses to a new stage in its <a href="/lifecycle/">lifecycle</a>, but regularly once the service goes <a href="/lifecycle/#live">live</a> also.</p>
<p>Services have a contract they are required to meet and a budget with which to meet it. They are expected to design, build, and operate whatever is required to address the needs in the contract, but they are free to do so as they see fit.</p>
<h2 id="service-governance">Service governance</h2>
<p>To govern the network of services, the <a href="/executive">executive</a> requires additional information about each service that helps them understand and make changes when needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Wardley Map of how the service is delivered and the components it requires</li>
<li>Performance data</li>
<li>The guidance that the service manager has rejected</li>
<li><a href="/coe-document/">Correction of Error documents</a> as they are created</li>
</ol>
