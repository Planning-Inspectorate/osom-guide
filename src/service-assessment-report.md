subtitle: Service Assessment Report
---

**To be updated with PINS D&D-specific approach.**

Service assessment reports are published in a repository visible to everybody in the service network by the Office of the CDIO after each assessment. They contain:

- **Assessment date**
- **Result:** _Met_ or _Not Met_
- **Stage:** the service's [lifecycle stage](/osom-guide/service-lifecycle), when assessed
- **Service manager**
- **Service contract:** a copy of, or link to the specific version of the service contract (in particular: description, [user needs](/osom-guide/user-needs), and [metrics](/osom-guide/service-performance-measures))
- **Assessors:** names of the people representing the CDIO
- **Assessment criteria**: an itemised list of [criteria](/osom-guide/service-assessment-criteria) used to assess the service, including:
  - criteria name, and link to more information
  - decision (_Met_ or _Not Met_)
  - what the team has done well
  - what the team needs to improve
