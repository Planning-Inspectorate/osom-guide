subtitle: Service Contract
---

Each service has a service contract, and that contract explains the critical information about the service:

1. What the service is and the [user needs](/osom-guide/user-needs) it meets
2. What [lifecycle stage](/osom-guide/service-lifecycle) the service is at
3. What evolutionary stage the service is at
4. How the service is used
5. How the [performance of the service is measured](/osom-guide/service-performance-measures/)
6. How to get help when the service isn't performing as expected
7. What other services the service depends upon

There is a [template service contract](/osom-guide/service-contract-template) to help you get started.
