The Correction of Error (CoE) process was inspired by the [AWS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html) Well-Architected framework and acts as a [systematic method of learning](/osom-guide/doctrine#do-we-use-systematic-mechanisms-of-learning) for the organisation's service network.

## The Correction of Errors review

The [Office of the CDIO](/osom-guide/office-of-the-cdio) should [conduct regular reviews](/osom-guide/office-of-the-cdio#review-correction-of-error-documents) with all service managers of the unreviewed, published [CoE documents](/osom-guide/correction-of-errors-document). This review allows other service managers to benefit from the experience of the error, without being a part of the service team that experienced the error.
