# Welcome to the PINS D&D Service Model User Guide

Welcome to the Planning Inspectorate's (PINS) Data & Digital Service Model User Guide.

This guide will become a key resource for:

- **Service managers** - looking for information about setting up and running their service teams.
- **Service team members** - looking to understand their role adn the broader responsibilities and support available to them.
- **Members of the Office of the Chief Digital and Information Officer (OCDIO)** - looking to understand processes and repsonsibilities as representatives of Rachel Graham, CDIO.
- **Customers/PINS colleagues** - looking for an in-depth understanding of the PINS D&D Service Model and demand management processes.

The service model we are adopting in PINS D&D is based on Stance's Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) but also draws from best practice across government and industry; and is being adapted to work for PINS, putting the **"people" in PINS at its heart**.

The contents of this guide are largely taken from [Stance's OSOM guide](https://osom.guide/) as a starting point, but this will evolve as we tailor the model to PINS' requirements. We welcome your [thoughts and feedback](mailto:jo.gerulaitis@planninginspectorate.gov.uk?subject=PINS_DD_SM_guide_feedback) to develop this.

# Introduction to OSOM

<img class="right pad-left" src="assets/img/operating-model-overview.png" alt="a diagram showing an overview of the basic parts of OSOM" title="OSOM Overview">

The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) is a template operating
model to help organisations adopt a service-based approach. This is in
opposition to a functional model, where capabilities are grouped by
skills and ownership of the delivery to users is an endeavour shared
between those functions.

The operating model has evolved by encouraging a [common set of good behaviours](/osom-guide/making-better-decisions) at multiple organisations and discovering an organisational design and supporting processes that occur as a consequence.

The key components of OSOM are an Office of the CDIO that provides
oversight & governance and a network of services that progress through
a simple [service lifecycle](/osom-guide/service-lifecycle) compatible with the
[Government Digital
Service's](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
[service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## A template operating model

OSOM is a template operating model. Each organisation is different,
and few organisations would be directly mappable onto OSOM
directly. Instead, it forms a general approach that should be
carefully adapted as needed to the organisation.

The key to adapting an operating model for any organisation is to be aware of the trade-offs being made with each compromise, both positive and negative. That way, governance can be established to balance the negative consequences, and full advantage can be taken of positive consequences.

## Elements of OSOM

### The Office of the CDIO

The [Office of the CDIO](/osom-guide/office-of-the-cdio) governs the network of services and
holds the managers of those services to account through various
mechanisms documented in terms of reference.

The Office of the CDIO also has a role in advocating and monitoring the adoption of [guides to better decisions](/osom-guide/making-better-decisions) throughout the organisation, which provides a collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour that should be encouraged wherever possible.

### The service network

[OSOM services](/osom-guide/services/) address the needs of users. For any given
service, the users may be external to the organisation, internal, or a
mixture of both.

Each service is built & operated by a Service Manager, who is
accountable for the service and the team required in all its lifecycle
phases - from discovery until its eventual retirement.
