subtitle: Office of the CDIO Member
---

Members of the Office of the CDIO have authority delegated to them by the CDIO who may task them with areas of interest as they see fit.

However, when members of the Office of the CDIO act, they do so entirely in the scope of the CDIOâ€™s accountability and responsibility and have no individual portfolio of their own _per se_.

This isn't to say that those members shouldn't have opinions, skills and specialisms. The Office of the CDIO as a whole needs to be able to assess finance, consider security and balance risk, understand strategy, and everything else that would be considered a constraint or an enabler in a modern organisation.

The important thing is ensuring that their interests are fully and completely aligned with the CDIO: they have no portfolio and no agenda of their own.
