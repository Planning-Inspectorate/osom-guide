      <h2 class="sub-title">Establishing a new Service</h2>
      <p>There are two occasions likely to arise where a new service might be needed. The first is that a set of previously unmet needs is identified - this could be as a new product line for the end consumer, or it could be to enhance how internal services work.</p>
<p>The second circumstance occurs when two or more existing services are addressing a need within their service boundary and the opportunity to remove duplication exists by consolidating that capability as a shared service that they - and other services could consume instead.</p>
<p>To establish the service in both cases, a service contract should be drafted that documents the user needs, a service manager should be appointed and a budget allocated for the discovery <a href="/lifecycle/">phase of development</a>.</p>
<p>When the discovery concludes, the outcome should be presented to the executive with the understanding that what has been learned may influence the contents of the service contract.</p>
