      <h2 class="sub-title">User Need</h2>
      <p>An organisation should be able to list the users it has, and the needs of those users that it strives to meet.</p>
<p>To understand the total activity of an organisation, the only thing necessary is to enumerate all of the needs.</p>
<p>This idea extends to the services that are provided. Each service accomodates a set of user needs. By understanding the needs of the user, each service can identify the most appropriate way of measuring the success or fitness of a service.</p>
<p>The Government Digital Service's Service Manual <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs">entry on user needs</a> is a good place to start learning about user needs, and how they use them.</p>
<h2 id="the-components-of-a-user-need">The components of a user need</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs#writing-user-needs">service manual's example user need</a> is a good example of a need that might be captured in a service contract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As a British person</em></p>
<p><em>I need to provide proof of my identity and visa permissions to border control</em></p>
<p><em>So that I can travel abroad and prove my identity</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The need captures <em>who</em> has the need (the user), <em>what</em> they need to do (the asset or activity), and <em>why</em> they need to do it (the outcome).</p>
<p>This user need is a particularly good example, because it doesn't make assumptions about <em>how</em> (a passport).</p>
<h2 id="outcomes-and-service-metrics">Outcomes &amp; Service Metrics</h2>
<p>Outcomes are encapsulated in the <em>why</em> part of a user need, and <a href="/measuring-service-performance/">service metrics</a> should be related the outcome.</p>
<p>Often finding a good way to measure a particular outcome is challenging. From the example above, it might be hard to become immediately aware if someone was unable to prove their identity abroad. However, as long as the <a href="/executive/">executive </a>can agree, a proxy measure can be used as a substitute for a direct measure.</p>
<p>In this case, it could be whether or not someone attempted to travel abroad having used the service.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Often when considering the needs a service strives to meet, people get confused with requirements. The service-level user needs captured in a service contract are often very different from the requirements a service may have for use.</p>
<p>Services may need particular user inputs to achieve the outcomes the user is looking for, and those needs may be expressed in story form, but that should remain a distinct concept from the needs of the user encapsulated in a service contract.</p>
